## 01_Logic_Building
Focuses on improving algorithmic thinking by visualizing logic before coding.
* **Flowchart.md**
  * Contains multiple flowchart diagrams for step-by-step problem solving.
  * Covers basic logical problems such as finding the maximum number.
  * Includes mathematical problems like factorial and Fibonacci series.

## 02_AuthPage
Demonstrates frontend fundamentals using pure HTML and CSS.
* **Key Highlights**
  * Login and Registration pages.
  * Well-structured and clean UI layout.
  * Responsive design for different screen sizes.
  * Organized folder structure with images and documentation.

## 03_SQL_Query
* Dedicated to practicing SQL queries on structured datasets.
* **SQL_Meet_Rokad.md**
  * Basic SQL queries for data retrieval.
  * Filtering and condition-based queries.
  * Subqueries for dependent data extraction.
  * Join operations to combine multiple related tables.

## 04_Javascript_Task
* JavaScript tasks focused on logic building and core language concepts.

* **Task1**
  * Array manipulation and restructuring.
  * Logical conditions to process elements.
  * Uses Promises to validate computed results.

* **Task3**
  * Uses JavaScript Symbols for unique object keys.
  * Safe storage and retrieval of data from objects.
  * Prevents key collisions using Symbols.


## 05_Rust

Rust programming exercises focused on core language and system-level concepts.

* **01_structure**
  * Uses structs to model real-world entities.
  * Implements methods for reading and modifying data.
  * Demonstrates encapsulation using getter and setter patterns.
  * Uses associated functions (static methods).
  * Shows multiple ways to instantiate structs.

* **02_serde_json**
  * Demonstrates serialization and deserialization using Serde.
  * Uses `serde` and `serde_json` crates
  * Converts structs to JSON strings and back.
  * Works with raw JSON values and literals.

* **03_Static_Variables**
  * Introduces static variables in Rust.
  * Uses `Mutex` and `RwLock` for concurrency safety.
  * Demonstrates shared-state access using `std::sync`.
  * Uses Enums to represent different request types.
  * Simulates controlled global state access.

* **04_packages_crates_and_modules**
  * Explains Rust Packages, Crates, and Modules.
  * Splits code across multiple files and folders.
  * Uses a structured module layout.
  * Combines structs, functions, and serde into a modular design.
  * Encourages clean and scalable architecture.

* **05_Hashmap_HashSet**
  * Demonstrates usage of HashMap and HashSet.
  * Performs insertion, retrieval, removal, and iteration.
  * Uses filtering techniques like `retain`.
  * Works with custom structs as keys or values.
